 <p> <b>PARTICIPATION:</b> You are expected to attend the classes. Participation is how you show your commitment to the course and to the other students taking the course with you. You are expected to share both of your mathematical knowledge and the feelings you have as you engage in doing mathematics. Students will obtain the full 5% for class conduct by default. Points may be deducted for repeatedly being late, repeatedly leaving early, sleeping or excessive yawning in class, very poor class attendance, or obnoxious behavior.
<p>When determining your letter grade, I will take into account (a) your attendance and punctuality, (b) the effort you put into the course and (c) your improvement during the course.</p>

<b> To get a good grade in this course, you should do the following:</b>
<ol type="a">
    <li><font color="red"><b>Most importantly,</b></font> you should study two hours outside of the classroom for each hour in classroom.</li><br>
    <li>Don't cheat on the homework. </li><br>
<li>Turn up to class, and do so on time.</li><br>
<li>Ask for help if you need it.</li><br>
<li>Learn the material the book and my notes. </li><br>
    </ol>
    <br>

            <br>
            <br>
 <p> <b>Homework Policies</b></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>(1) Homework is due at the beginning of class on the listed date. No late homework will be accepted.</li><br>
<li>(2) You should read the material in the textbook as well as attending lecture. Some homework problems may depend on material in the book which is not covered in class.</li><br>
<li>(3) I encourage you to work in groups to solve the problems; your write-ups, however, should be completed individually.</li><br>
<li>(4) I will assign homework on a weekly basis; I expect clearly organized and worded solutions.</li>

              <p> <b>Honor Code</b></p>
All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor [AT] colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion).

        <br>    <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html"> http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html</a>


<p><b>Student classroom and course-related behavior</b></p>

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. See policies at <br>
            <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html</a>
            If you are having a problem with some aspect of the course, you should discuss it with me in a civil manner. Outbursts directed at the instructor or grader for this course will not be tolerated.



            <p> <b>Missed Exams</b></p>
If you know that you are going to miss an exam or cannot take the final exam at the scheduled time, please notify your instructor immediately. If you miss the first midterm exam for any acceptable reason (e.g. religious obligation, documented illness), it will be replaced by your second midterm exam score, if you miss the second midterm exam for any acceptable reason, it will be replaced by your final exam score. If you miss both midterm exams for acceptable reasons, each midterm score will be replaced by your final exam score. If you miss the final exam (unless it is for an acceptable reason), you will score zero on the final and you should expect to fail the course.

            <p> <b>Religious Obligations</b></p>
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. In this class, you should notify your instructor of any conflict immediately. <br>
            <a href="hhttp://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html">http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html</a>




            <p> <b>Statement on Discrimination and Harassment</b></p>
The University of Colorado Boulder (CU-Boulder) is committed to maintaining a positive learning, working, and living environment. CU-Boulder will not tolerate acts of discrimination or harassment based upon Protected Classes or related retaliation against or by any employee or student. For purposes of this CU-Boulder policy, "Protected Classes" refers to race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (OSC) at 303-492-5550. Information about the ODH, the above referenced policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding discrimination or harassment can be obtained at <a href="hhttp://www.colorado.edu/odh">http://www.colorado.edu/odh</a>.
